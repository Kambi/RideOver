RideOver: I'll be Right Over Mobile App
Once you login you will be given either the option to share a ride, which means that you can offer a ride to someone, or you can get a ride, which means that you can browse and see what rides people are offering and see if one of them fits your criteria. If you share a ride, you will be asked to fill out certain information, such as Starting From, Going to, Depart Time and Arrival Time.
Once they put in their destination, there will be a Google map generated for their specified route, so incase some user who is looking for a ride wants to get dropped off somewhere in the middle of that route, they can request that to the driver. The driver will also fill out any price if they choose to request money for the ride, and we will have an option to contact the user. The driver will also have to put in how many seats they’re offering for the ride. If you choose the get a ride option, you will be directed to all the rides posted, and you can filter which day you’re leaving, where you’re starting from, and going to.
You will then find a list of available rides, and you can click on whichever you want to look at. When you click on a ride you will find the following information: Where they’re starting from and going to, a map of their route, their price for ride, and how many seats they have available. You can contact the driver and ask for more information, or you can just book yourself a seat for that trip.
